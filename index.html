	<h1> MY GIRLFRIEND'S CAT: RIVER </h1>
	<div>
		<p> My girlfriend is currently away on business travel, so I have been "stuck" with taking care of her cat, River.  I figured the internet likes cats and stuff and I might be able to monetize this webpage somehow and get in on the cash cow of internet cuteness, so I'm just going to roll with this.  Beachfront property, here I come!</p>

		<h3>Speaking of cute, check this out!</h3>

		<p> She's pretty excited about me taking care of her, as you can tell.  This huge close up of her borders on obsenity.</p>

		The trip over here always blows her mind that there's a world beyond her little apartment.
