	<div>
		<p class="textbox"> My girlfriend is currently away on business travel, so I have been "stuck" with taking care of her cat, River.  I figured the internet likes cats and stuff and I might be able to monetize this webpage somehow and get in on the cash cow of internet cuteness, so I'm just going to roll with this.  Beachfront property, here I come!</p>

		<p class="textbox"> She's pretty excited about me taking care of her, as you can tell.  This huge close up of her borders on obsenity. [UPDATE] I figured out how to resize this so it's not as huge!</p>

		<p class="textbox">The trip over here always blows her mind that there's a world beyond her little apartment.</p>
